🧪 Quality & UX Considerations

Disabled actions during API calls

Clear loading indicators

Graceful error states

Fallback to manual OTP if auto-read fails

Defensive input validation

Clean separation of concerns (UI / logic / API)

⚠️ Known Limitations

Auto OTP reading depends on SMS format from backend

No persistent login session implemented (by design, out of scope)
